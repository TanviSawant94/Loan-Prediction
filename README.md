# Loan-Prediction
In current economy, lending someone money as a loan is a complicated business. There are various factors that are needed to be considered in order to calculate the credibility of the applicant. Another important point to note â€“ whether the applicant is capable enough to repay the loan? As banks love to thrive on the interests of customers, but they love it, even more, when customers don't repay on loan payments. So, businesses as such would love to have such analysis before taking the decision - whether or not to sanction the loan.

Taking this problem into consideration, data science can aid to predict such outcome and approve the loan based on the historical data we have from businesses. In this way, business would know beforehand whether to lend the applicant money or not based on the data present on his file compared to data science models analysis.

Estimating the probability that an individual would default on their loan, is useful for banks to decide whether to sanction a loan to the individual or not. We introduce an effective prediction technique that helps the banker to predict the credit risk for customers who have applied for loan. A prototype is described in the paper which can be used by the organizations for making the correct decision for approving or rejecting the request for loan of particular customers. 

By mining the Big Data of the previous records of the people to whom the loan was granted before and on the basis of these records/experiences the machine was trained using the machine learning model. Which will give the most accurate result. The main objective of this paper is to predict whether assigning the loan to particular person will be safe or not.

Data Understanding
There are two datasets available: train dataset and test dataset. The train data set is now supplied to the model, training of the model is dependent on the date set. The data to the test data set is every new applicant details filled at the time of application. After the operation of testing, model predict whether the new applicant is a perfect case for sanctioning of the loan or not based upon the inference of the training data sets.
